# Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to analyze the Abstract Syntax Trees
of Go files to identify areas of concern in large Golang repositories.
Once repositories become large enough, it becomes very hard to get a grasp of
things at scale. This is where these sorts of analyses come into
play. After performing these types of analyses, they can be forwarded
to LLMs to reason with code even quicker.
